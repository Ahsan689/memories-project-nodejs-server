npm init -y 

install body-parser cors express mongoose nodemon

in package.json
"scripts": {
    "start":"nodemon index.js"
  },

in main object,
"type": "module", to use import instead of require.

-------------------- VERY IMPORTANT ---------------
We have exported "app" in index.js file. to overcome these error in vercel,
No exports found in module "../index.js"
Did you forget to export a function or a server?
